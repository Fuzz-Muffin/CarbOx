# CarbOx
A somewhat general python code for installing oxygen groups in atomistic models of carbons using some simple heuristics and chemical intuition.

## What you need to already have
This code cannot generate simulation-ready oxidised carbon models from scratch. You need to provide an atomistic model (in `.xyz` formate) of whatever carbon material you are interested in. As `xyz` is a smiple and flexible text-based file format, it should be rather straightforward to prepare your structure for CarbOx.

## How to CarbOx

Maybe Flo is a good guy to outline the steps here...
