# CarbOx
A somewhat general python code for installing oxygen groups in atomistic models of carbons via some simple heuristics

## What you need to already have
This code cannot generate simulation-ready oxidised carbon models from scratch, you need to provide an atomistic model of some carbon in an `.xyz` file format. This is a smiple and flexible file format, should be a doddle to port whatever your carbon structure is currently in to an `.xyz` format.
